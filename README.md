A Tensorflow implementation of the paper: Mousavian, Arsalan, et al. [3D Bounding Box Estimation Using Deep Learning and Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00496) by Fu-Hsiang Chan.

Original Code downloaded from github repository of [small-corgi]. Instead of using RGB images as input, stereo images were fed as input. Main aim was to try and see if the network could learn depth information from the disparity between the two images. Meant for personal use.
