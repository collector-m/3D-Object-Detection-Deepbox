# 3D Bounding Box Estimation Using Deep Learning and Geometry

A Tensorflow implementation of the paper: Mousavian, Arsalan, et al. [3D Bounding Box Estimation Using Deep Learning and Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00496) by Fu-Hsiang Chan.

Original Code downloaded from github repository of small-corgi. Certain changes made by me whilst testing the code. Meant for personal use.
